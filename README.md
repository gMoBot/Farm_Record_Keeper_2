# Farm_Record_Keeper_2
refactored and improved pesticide record-keeping application
This Java Swing application aims to streamline the record-keeping process for tree-fruit growers specifically.
Growers can enter profiles for their blocks, applicators and products. They can then enter specific application data which references these profiles.
Growers can then output their records in formats which satisfy the record-keeping requirements for their processors, the federal government, and the State of Michigan.
